As a fan of THe lord of the Rings , i'm gonna try with **MOVE** to encoding as many rings as possible as *digitals* assets.






*For the momemt Libra are on the Testnet, no front-end will be implemented here.Only the Modules and scripts code will be expenrienced. If any Front-end compatible frameworks are available **maybe** i will make a dApp*




TODO : Sending an event message.



1. Structure of  the **Rings**

A **Ring** are a *module* and *scripts* that will be attached to a Libra address.

23 April: *ForfeRings* principal Module.
*Contract.move* is the main script of each modules.
